# OnlyRV

An attempt to model Radial Velocity signals due to stellar activity and possible planetary companions, as done by Faria et al.(2016), using a Gaussian Processes likelihood and diffusive nested sampling by DNest4 (Brewer and Mackey 2016).
Refer [this](https://github.com/eggplantbren/Exoplanet/blob/gp_quasiperiodic_noise/display.py) and [this](https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest4) for the original code being developed in this context.
